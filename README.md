# Manual Linear Regression
This notebook demonstrates a manual implementation of linear regression using the Least Squares method (normal equation). Instead of using scikit-learn or other libraries, it computes the regression coefficients using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse with NumPy. The code works on both a small custom dataset and a synthetic dataset generated via `mglearn.datasets.make_wave`.

The goal was to understand the underlying mathematics of linear regression without relying on pre-built machine learning tools.
